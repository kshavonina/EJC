    // create methods createSingleDeckShip(), createThreeDeckShip() ... for creating ships on map

    // create method for printing map of ships (for tests) and method for printing resulting map on each step of game

    // create class (if it is a good idea) for sea battle (SeaBattle) and make constant for number of attempts (gaming time process)
    // in field of class. and then in Main class create object SeaBattle and play game, using methods of SeaBattle class.
    // I think SeaBattle class and its methods should be package private. Also I should consider an idea of creating class for
    // map (sea map with ships) and make methods as printMap and generateMap in it. Maybe class SeaMap (another name create, pls)
    // should be inner. Or don't do it. Because I can use these maps for another SeaBattle (for example with two players)

    // maybe ShipsMap? and think about class PlayerShipsMap (map, which player will see; ShipsMap for only game process)
